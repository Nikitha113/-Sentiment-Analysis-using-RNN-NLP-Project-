# -Sentiment-Analysis-using-RNN-NLP-Project-
This project demonstrates a basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** pipeline using an **Embedding layer** and a **Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN)** to classify text sentiment as **Positive** or **Negative**
The main goal of this project is to understand how text data is processed and learned
by deep learning models.

Project Overview
- Convert text into numerical form using Tokenizer
- Pad sequences to maintain equal input length
- Learn word meanings using an Embedding layer
- Capture sequence information using SimpleRNN
- Predict sentiment using Softmax classification

 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

 Dataset
A small sample dataset with labeled sentences:
- **1 → Positive sentiment**
- **0 → Negative sentiment**
